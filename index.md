I like technical challenges. Whether it is with code or my classic car. You can also see this in my hobby projects. Keeping old cars running or code projects to make my or someone else's life easier.

## Work

I started by a secondment agency as Oracle Database developer, then switched to c# developer and from 2018 I am a DevOps engineer.
