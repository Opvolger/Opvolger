# Starfive VisionFive 2

Here I will (if it's worth it) keep track of my projects I've done with the Starfive VisionFive 2.
(I was/am an Early Adopter).

## Fedora with ATI Radeon 5450, running Quake2

On the day I received the Starfive VisionFive 2, this was early in the evening... I already had Quake2 working late late in evening. (After updating firmware and getting Image-69 working). This was nothing more than a 'make' and remove the *.so files which were not "OpenGL ES3" and it worked. Unfortunately, I couldn't get many other games to work due to the limitation of only having "OpenGL ES 3.0" working on the onboard GPU.

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/FedoraATIRadeon5450.md) was born! (Part I)

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/UbuntuATIRadeonR9_290.md) was born! (Part II)
