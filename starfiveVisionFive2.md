# Starfive VisionFive 2

Here I will (if it's worth it) keep track of my projects I've done with the Starfive VisionFive 2.
(I was/am an Early Adopter).

On the day I received the Starfive VisionFive 2, this was early in the evening... I already had Quake2 working late late in evening. (After updating firmware and getting Image-69 working). This was nothing more than a 'make' and remove the *.so files which were not "OpenGL ES3" and it worked. Unfortunately, I couldn't get many other games to work due to the limitation of only having "OpenGL ES 3.0" working on the onboard GPU.

## Ubuntu 24.10 has now kernel 6.11

We can now use the Ubuntu 24.10 kernel, only have to use custom u-boot/opensbi flash-files.

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/Ubuntu2410_outofthebox.md) was born! (Part VI)

## OpenSUSE Tumbleweed with ATI Radeon R9 290 mainline kernel

Mailline kernel is now possible!

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/OpenSUSEATIRadeonR9_290_mainline.md) was born! (Part V)

## OpenSUSE Tumbleweed with ATI Radeon R9 290

Project Part III was fun, but now OpenSUSE

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/OpenSUSEATIRadeonR9_290.md) was born! (Part IV)

## Ubuntu 23.10 with ATI Radeon R9 290 / ATI Radeon 5450

Project Part II was fun, but now its runs better!

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/UbuntuATIRadeonR9_290_2023_11_20.md) was born! (Part III)

## Ubuntu with ATI Radeon R9 290

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/UbuntuATIRadeonR9_290.md) was born! (Part II)

## Fedora with ATI Radeon 5450, running Quake2

- So this [project](starfiveVisionFive2/FedoraATIRadeon5450.md) was born! (Part I)
